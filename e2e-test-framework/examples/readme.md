This folder contains two examples of using the E2E Test Framework to test Drasi:

1. [Building Comfort](building_comfort/readme.md) - shows how to run a test using a model-based source.
2. [Population](population/readme.md) - shows how to run a test using a script-based source.

Both examples include scripts and support files to make the process of running the test and interacting with the Test Service easier.
